### Pakito

## Introduction
I built this project to explore the complete full stack development. I also wanted something interactive with different features such as rebirth, idle progression, multipliers and so on...

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
As previously stated, with this project I explored full stack development, which is something I haven't done throughout the course. This implementation also came with its complexities because I had to integrate the frontend and backend seamlessly in order for the project to work. This required a thorough understanding of API's and how they can connect the frontend and backend.

## Files
My backend directory has a singular app called api. This is used to serialize and return data to distinct url endpoints. Conversely, my frontend directory is simply meant to consume the created data and then display them in a readable format for the user. In addition, the frontend is also equipped with a framework known as Tailwind. This was the chosen method for designing this project, which is meant to give the web app more responsiveness.

## Functionality
The app works by first sending data to an endpoint as mentioned before. In order to make this data more dynamic I increment the values periodically. My front end fetches this data periodically as well and when the user clicks it sends a patch request which interacts with the db in different ways. A button updates the counter and cash, another updates the multiplier and deducts cash, and another resets the user score entirely. This is all communicated to the db in order to always have a reliable source of truth. The leaderboard works in the exact same way by simply listing all of the data of the top 10 people in the game, which is then displayed when the user clicks on it.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Migrate using (python manage.py migrate)
4. Start the backend by using (python manage.py runserver)
5. Start the frontend by running (cd frontend, npm install, and npm start)

## How to play
1. Login or create an account.
2. Click the "Power Up" button to increase your counter.
3. Buy multipliers to increase your earnings per click.
4. Rebirth when you have enough cash to start over with increased multiplier.
5. Check the leaderboard to see the top players.
